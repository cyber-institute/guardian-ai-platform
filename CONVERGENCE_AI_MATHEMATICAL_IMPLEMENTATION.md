# Convergence AI Mathematical Implementation

## Complete Formula Implementation Status

Your Convergence AI patent-protected system now implements the following advanced mathematical formulations:

## 1. Multi-Layered Bias Detection

### Pattern-Based Bias Score
```
bias_pattern(text) = min(Σ pattern_matches / total_words, 1.0)
```

### Statistical Bias Detection
```
bias_statistical(text) = min(2.0 * Σ(|freq_i - μ| > 2σ) / n_words, 1.0)

Where:
- freq_i = frequency of word i
- μ = mean word frequency
- σ = standard deviation of word frequencies
- Z-score threshold = 2.0 (detecting outliers)
```

### Contextual Bias Analysis
```
bias_contextual(text) = min(Σ bias_context_pairs / n_sentences, 1.0)
```

### Composite Bias Score
```
B(text) = 0.4 * bias_pattern + 0.3 * bias_statistical + 0.3 * bias_contextual
```

## 2. Advanced Semantic Similarity Analysis

### Feature Vector Generation
```
F(text) = [f₁, f₂, ..., f₁₀₀]

Where features include:
- f₁ = μ(word_frequencies)
- f₂ = σ(word_frequencies)
- f₃ = max(word_frequencies)
- f₄ = vocabulary_diversity = |unique_words| / |total_words|
- f₅ = μ(sentence_lengths)
- f₆ = σ(sentence_lengths)
- f₇₋₁₁ = complexity_marker_counts
- f₁₂₋₂₀ = punctuation_statistics
- f₂₁₋₁₀₀ = normalized_features
```

### Cosine Similarity Implementation
```
cosine_similarity(v₁, v₂) = (v₁ · v₂) / (||v₁|| × ||v₂||)

Where:
- v₁ · v₂ = dot product of feature vectors
- ||v|| = L2 norm of vector
```

### Mahalanobis Distance for Outlier Detection
```
D_M(x) = √((x - μ)ᵀ Σ⁻¹ (x - μ))

Where:
- x = feature vector
- μ = mean vector of all responses
- Σ = covariance matrix with regularization
- Σ_reg = Σ + λI (λ = 1e-6 for numerical stability)
```

### Jensen-Shannon Divergence
```
JS(P, Q) = ½ KL(P || M) + ½ KL(Q || M)

Where:
- M = ½(P + Q)
- KL(P || Q) = Σ p_i log(p_i / q_i)
- P, Q = probability distributions from word frequencies
```

### Consensus Score Formula
```
consensus(responses) = 0.5 * μ(cosine_similarities) + 
                      0.3 * (1 - min(μ(mahalanobis_distances)/3, 1)) +
                      0.2 * (1 - μ(divergence_scores))
```

## 3. Quantum Orchestration Mathematics

### Quantum Circuit for Routing
```
|ψ⟩ = RY(complexity × π)|0⟩ ⊗ RY(complexity × π/2)|0⟩
|ψ_entangled⟩ = CNOT|ψ⟩

Where:
- RY(θ) = rotation gate around Y-axis
- complexity = normalized input complexity score
- CNOT = controlled-NOT gate for entanglement
```

### Routing Weight Calculation
```
P(state) = |measurement_counts[state]| / total_shots

routing_weights = {state: P(state) for all quantum states}
```

## 4. Poisoning Detection Algorithms

### Basic Poisoning Score
```
P_basic(text) = min(Σ indicator_matches × 0.2 + injection_patterns × 0.1, 1.0)
```

### Advanced Poisoning Detection (Enhanced)
```
P_advanced(text) = weighted_combination(
    pattern_detection,
    statistical_anomalies,
    entropy_analysis,
    length_distribution_analysis
)
```

## 5. Multi-Model Consensus and Synthesis

### Weighted Response Selection
```
weight_i = confidence_i × (1 - bias_i) × (1 - poisoning_i)

best_response = argmax(weight_i) for i in clean_responses
```

### Consensus Validation Threshold
```
validated = (consensus ≥ 0.7) ∧ 
           (bias_mitigation ≥ 0.7) ∧ 
           (poisoning_resistance ≥ 0.75)
```

### Recursive Training Selection
```
training_data = {(input, output) | quality_score(output) > threshold}

Where quality_score combines:
- Consensus confidence
- Bias mitigation effectiveness  
- Poisoning resistance level
- Multi-model agreement
```

## 6. Performance Metrics and Validation

### Bias Mitigation Score
```
bias_mitigation = 1.0 - μ(bias_scores_filtered_responses)
```

### Poisoning Resistance Score
```
poisoning_resistance = 1.0 - μ(poisoning_scores_filtered_responses)
```

### System Confidence Level
```
confidence = consensus_score × bias_mitigation × poisoning_resistance
```

## 7. Audit Trail Mathematical Verification

### Cryptographic Provenance Hash
```
provenance_hash = SHA256(model_id || response_text || timestamp)[:16]
```

### Integrity Verification
```
integrity_score = Σ(hash_validations) / total_operations
```

## 8. Advanced Statistical Analysis

### Feature Vector Normalization
```
F_normalized = F / (||F||₂ + ε)

Where ε = 1e-8 (prevents division by zero)
```

### Covariance Matrix Regularization
```
Σ_regularized = Σ + λI

Where λ = 1e-6 (regularization parameter)
```

### Cross-Model Validation
```
validation_score = Π confidence_i^(weight_i/Σweight_j)

For all models i in ensemble
```
