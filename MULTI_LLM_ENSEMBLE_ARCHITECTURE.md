# GUARDIAN Multi-LLM Ensemble Architecture
## Concurrent Processing Framework for Policy Evaluation

### Executive Summary

GUARDIAN now features a sophisticated multi-LLM ensemble system that processes policy evaluations through multiple AI models concurrently, then synthesizes their collective intelligence. This approach mirrors CPU multithreading concepts but applied to document analysis, significantly enhancing evaluation quality and reliability.

## **Architecture Overview**

### **Two Processing Modes**

#### **1. Parallel Processing (Multithreading Analogy)**
```
Document → [OpenAI GPT-4o] ↘
          [Anthropic Claude] → Weighted Consensus → Final Score
          [Groq Llama3]     ↗
          [Ollama Local]    ↗
          [Hugging Face]    ↗
```

- **Execution**: All LLMs evaluate simultaneously using async/await
- **Synthesis**: Weighted consensus based on service reliability
- **Speed**: Fastest available analysis (limited by slowest service)
- **Use Case**: Quick evaluations, initial screening, high-volume processing

#### **2. Daisy-Chain Refinement (Sequential Enhancement)**
```
Document → OpenAI → Enhanced Context → Anthropic → Refined Context → Groq → Final Analysis
```

- **Execution**: Each LLM builds upon previous analysis
- **Synthesis**: Later responses weighted more heavily (refinement effect)
- **Quality**: Higher accuracy through iterative improvement
- **Use Case**: Detailed compliance review, complex policy analysis

## **Technical Implementation**

### **Concurrent Processing Framework**

```python
class MultiLLMEnsemble:
    async def evaluate_policy_concurrent(self, document, domain, use_daisy_chain=False):
        if use_daisy_chain:
            return await self._daisy_chain_evaluation(document, domain)
        else:
            return await self._parallel_evaluation(document, domain)
    
    async def _parallel_evaluation(self, document, domain):
        # Create tasks for all available services
        tasks = [self._evaluate_with_service(service, document, domain) 
                for service in self.available_services]
        
        # Execute concurrently with timeout
        results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
        
        # Synthesize weighted consensus
        return self._synthesize_consensus(results, domain)
```

### **Service Reliability Weights**
```python
processing_weights = {
    'openai': 0.95,      # Highest quality
    'anthropic': 0.95,   # Highest quality  
    'groq': 0.9,         # Fast, reliable
    'perplexity': 0.85,  # Real-time research
    'together_ai': 0.8,  # Good open models
    'huggingface': 0.7,  # Specialized models
    'ollama': 1.0        # Always available baseline
}
```

### **Consensus Synthesis Algorithm**

```python
def _synthesize_consensus(self, responses, domain):
    weighted_scores = {}
    total_weight = 0
    
    for response in successful_responses:
        service_weight = self.processing_weights[response.service_name]
        confidence_weight = response.confidence_score
        combined_weight = service_weight * confidence_weight
        
        total_weight += combined_weight
        
        # Aggregate policy scores
        for metric, score in response.policy_scores.items():
            weighted_scores[metric] += score * combined_weight
    
    # Normalize to final consensus scores
    final_scores = {metric: weighted_sum / total_weight 
                   for metric, weighted_sum in weighted_scores.items()}
    
    return EnsembleResult(consensus_score=final_scores, ...)
```
