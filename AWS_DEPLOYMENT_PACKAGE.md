## Support and Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
```bash
# Weekly health check
curl -f https://your-app-url.com/_stcore/health

# Check application logs
eb logs

# Monitor costs
aws ce get-cost-and-usage --time-period Start=$(date -d '1 month ago' +%Y-%m-01),End=$(date +%Y-%m-01)
```

### Scaling Operations
```bash
# Scale up for high traffic
eb scale 3

# Scale down for cost savings
eb scale 1

# Update application
eb deploy
```

## Emergency Procedures

### Rollback
```bash
eb deploy --version-label previous-version
```

### Database Restore
```bash
aws rds restore-db-instance-from-db-snapshot \
  --db-instance-identifier guardian-restore \
  --db-snapshot-identifier guardian-backup-snapshot
```

### Cost Emergency
```bash
# Stop all instances temporarily
eb scale 0

# Stop RDS (can restart later)
aws rds stop-db-instance --db-instance-identifier guardian-production-db
```

## Next Steps After Deployment

1. **Custom Domain** (Optional)
   - Purchase domain through Route 53
   - Request SSL certificate
   - Configure CNAME record

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Monitor CloudWatch metrics for 1 week
   - Right-size instances based on actual usage
   - Configure auto-scaling policies

3. **Enhanced Security**
   - Set up AWS WAF for application protection
   - Configure VPC Flow Logs
   - Enable GuardDuty for threat detection
