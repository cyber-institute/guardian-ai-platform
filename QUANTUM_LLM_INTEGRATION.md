## Technical Implementation

### Quantum Routing Process

1. **Circuit Initialization**
   ```python
   # 2-qubit basic routing
   qc = QuantumCircuit(2, 2)
   qc.h(0)  # Superposition
   qc.h(1)
   
   # 3-qubit enhanced routing with content biasing
   qc = QuantumCircuit(3, 3)
   qc.h(0), qc.h(1), qc.h(2)
   qc.ry(bias_angle, qubit)  # Content-specific biasing
   qc.cx(0, 1), qc.cx(1, 2)  # Entanglement
   ```

2. **Content Analysis Biasing**
   - AI content detection: Bias toward GPT-4 and Claude
   - Quantum/Security content: Bias toward specialized models
   - Ethics/Policy content: Bias toward governance-focused models

3. **Quantum Measurement**
   - Probabilistic collapse to specific model combinations
   - Measurement results map to predefined LLM ensembles
   - Confidence weighting based on quantum probabilities
