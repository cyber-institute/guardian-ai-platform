Qiskit Router for CONVERGENCE AI / GUARDIAN

Overview

The qiskit_router.py module introduces a quantum-assisted routing mechanism for large language models (LLMs) within the GUARDIAN/CONVERGENCE AI orchestration framework. It uses simulated quantum circuits (via IBM's Qiskit SDK) to probabilistically select which LLMs should process a given input, enabling non-deterministic, parallel-ready inference that mimics superposition-based decision-making.

Purpose

This module demonstrates how quantum principles such as superposition and probabilistic measurement can be incorporated into modern AI orchestration, providing:

Randomized but traceable LLM selection

Redundancy-resilient routing

Hybrid quantum-classical readiness

Scalable architecture aligned with quantum computing futures


Features

Simulates a 2-qubit quantum circuit using Qiskit

Encodes four routing outcomes based on measurement results:

00: GPT-4 + Claude

01: GPT-4 + Local LLM

10: Claude + Local LLM

11: All three models


Modular function quantum_llm_selector() returns selected models

Easily extendable for trust score weighting, task-based logic, or future QPU support


Requirements

Python 3.8+

Qiskit (install via pip install qiskit)


Usage

# Install dependencies
pip install qiskit

from qiskit_router import quantum_llm_selector

# Example usage
models = quantum_llm_selector()
print("Selected models:", models)

Integration with GUARDIAN

You can integrate this router module into your existing orchestration pipeline:

from qiskit_router import quantum_llm_selector

def route_input(document):
    selected_models = quantum_llm_selector()
    for model in selected_models:
        response = query_llm(model, document)
        # continue synthesis logic...

Future Extensions

Support for hybrid classical/quantum decision-making

Task-specific routing logic based on input metadata

Use of Variational Quantum Circuits (VQC) for dynamic weight optimization

IBM QPU integration for live experiments
